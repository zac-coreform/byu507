PROJECT 3

Complete the following two-dimensional finite element analysis code for diffusion/steady-state heat conduction. You will need to incorporate functionality here that was created in Homeworks 5, 6, and 7.

For your final submission, please send your completed code, in addition to all files necessary to run the code. Then, please run the code on the brick.obj file using thermal conductivity defined by the BrickKappa function. Take the bottom boundary condition to be Dirichlet and g=10 (degrees celsius), the top to be Neumann with flux h=0.3, the left and right Neumann with h=0 (i.e. insulated or periodic). Choose f=0 (no internal heat generation). Plot a surface contour plot.

Finally, describe what happens (using text and contour plots) when the thermal conductivity of the mortar (at the two "holes" in the mesh) is significantly lower than that of the clay for the brick, when the thermal conductivity of the mortar is approximately equal to that of the brick, and when the thermal conductivity of the mortar is much greater than that of the brick.

This is a copy of your mesh. 

The faces are labeled in black and with an "f" prefix. The vertices are in dark red and with a "v" prefix. 

Every face has an ordered set of vertices, 0-3, that describes locally what ordering the vertices have in the face. These are in blue.

Speaking to your submitted example, notice how vertices 1, 2, and 9 are not included on your list. These are interior vertices. However, 

...each face will have a local reference to the four vertices that comprise it. 
These will indices will be the "a" values in the IEN array. The face indices are the "e" values for the IEN array.
