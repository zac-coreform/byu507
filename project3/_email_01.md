Hi Kendrick, 

Thank you for the registration reminder -- I'm now enrolled in your 594R section. 

Regarding 507, I've taken today and tomorrow off to complete the remaining work, so I'll probably be peppering you with questions at all hours instead of before 9:00 / after 5:00. :)

I hope that's ok -- specifically, that it's ok with you if I err on the side of asking more rather than fewer questions, on the hope that you answer only those you can answer without inconvenience, and freely ignore any that exceed a reasonable limit. 

I'm hoping to take that approach both because my natural tendency is to try not to be a bother, and because after looking more closely at the work I have remaining in Project 3, I'm a bit overwhelmed at the mass of material / code / functionality that I don't recall discussing directly in class. 

For example (and as an initial question), it's not at all clear to me how much of surfacemesh.py I need to or am expected to understand. I can see that I can access boundary edges and vertices, but there doesn't appear to be an obvious "element" object whose local indices I can access to construct the IEN. I might just be brain cramping -- I'd be grateful for any help you can offer.

Best, 

Zac

To be honest, I'm kind of despairing of being able to actually complete this project on my own. Is this something I can really expect to do without the benefit of having attended the office hours for guidance and explanation of things like this?
