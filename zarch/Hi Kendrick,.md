Hi Kendrick, 

Hope you're well. Sorry for the delay: from our conversation on Monday, I think I was supposed to send a brief note outlining my plans for submitting outstanding work in 507. If I didn't misunderstand, the most conservative option discussed was to submit all missing assignments / corrections by one week from today, so if that still works, I'll make that my plan. 

You also suggested I email you requesting that you re-asses my HW #2 corrections submission, which received very few points. I think I may have discovered what happened there: I (late-)submitted both the quadrature and exercises from Hughes to the original HW #2 assignment submission form, but I seem to have omitted the exercises when submitting the corrections. I'll add that to the corrections submission for convenience. 

If I've forgotten or misapprehended anything we discussed, please do let me know. I appreciate very much your understanding and willingness to work with me to accommodate the issues I've been dealing with.

Best regards, 

Zac White
