e0 = log( ( integral_omega( (u^h - u)**2 d-omega ) )**(0.5) ) <= 
        log(c) + (p + 1) * log(h) + log( || u ||_(p+1) )

# 
e1 = log( ( integral_omega( (u^h - u)**2 + (u^h_x - u_x)**2 d-omega ) )**(0.5) ) <= 
        # since m=1, p+1-m = p
        log(c) + p * log(h) + log( || u ||_(p+1) )







Also, modify your Gaussian Quadrature routine to work for two-dimensional quadrilaterals. To do so, take your one-dimensional Gaussian quadrature code and make the following changes:

1. Take a quadrature point as [\xi_g1, \eta_g2] where \xi_g1 is a quadrature point in one dimension and \eta_g2 is a (potentially different) quadrature point in the next direction

2. Take a quadrature weight as w_g1*w_g2, where g1 and g2 are given as above.
